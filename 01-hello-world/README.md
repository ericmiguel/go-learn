# hello-world.go

To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.

```bash
go run hello-world.go
```

Sometimes weâ€™ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.

```bash
go build hello-world.go
```

We can then execute the built binary directly.

```bash
./hello-world
```
